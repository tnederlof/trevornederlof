# Present

I have always been fascinated by how people wrangle and analyze data. There is something magical about a single person or a small team making significant progress in their work/mission due to utilizing a well-crafted tool/language. This curiosity has led me to use R, Python, and SQL as languages on a tool bench, selecting the right language for the job. In recent years, I have gotten quite involved on the infrastructure/architecture side of things, from Linux VMs to containers and Kubernetes.

Currently, I am a Principal Solutions Architect at Posit (formerly RStudio), where I empower data science teams in organizations to collaborate and productionalize their data science workflows. Half of my time is spent working with data science teams to improve their effectiveness and the other half with IT/DevOps to ensure optimal architecture, integration and configuration.

Off the computer, I live in the Hudson Valley, New York, and spend as much time outside as I can. You can find me gardening, trail running/backpacking in the Catskills, cycling farm roads, or cooking up something new. I am also a fire commissioner and volunteer firefighter in Livingston, NY, where I proudly serve my community.
