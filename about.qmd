# Present
I have always been fascinated by the diverse ways people wrangle and analyze data. There is something magical about a single person or a small team making significant progress in their work/mission due to utilizing a well-crafted tool/language. This curiosity has led me to use R, Python, Julia, and SQL as languages on a tool bench, selecting the right language for the job.

Currently, I am a Solutions Engineer at RStudio, where I empower data science teams in organizations to collaborate better and productionalize their data science workflows.

Off the computer, I live in the Hudson Valley, New York, and spend as much time outside as I can. You can find me trail running and backpacking in the Catskills, cycling farm roads, or cooking up something new with fresh produce.

# Past

* Quantitative Portfolio Developer at Risk Premium Investments (learned a lot about programming, databases, infrastructure and productionalization as I was responsible for setting it all up)
* Portfolio Solutions Developer at Neuberger Berman (learned a lot about infrastructure at a larger company with IT constraints and solution selling to large asset owners)
