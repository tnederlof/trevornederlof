## Welcome to my personal website!

Hello, I am Trevor Nederlof, a Principal Solutions Architect at Posit (formerly RStudio), where I empower data science teams in organizations to collaborate and productionalize their data science workflows. I also enjoy exploring and pushing the boundaries of cloud-native technologies, especially Kubernetes.
